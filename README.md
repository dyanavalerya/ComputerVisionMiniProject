# ComputerVisionMiniProject
A manual classifier that distinguishes between three different classes of the same category. Category: garbabe, classes: empty can, plastic bottle, cardboard.

This mini project is part of the Robot Vision course at Aalborg University.

Part of the training data is taken from:
1. https://github.com/cardstdani/WasteClassificationNeuralNetwork
2. https://github.com/garythung/trashnet
3. https://github.com/AgaMiko/waste-datasets-review
4. https://github.com/arthur-cen/smartTrashBin/tree/master/data

The project is unfinished: a knn classifier was supposed to be used with all the training data. The manual classifier only makes use of the test data.
